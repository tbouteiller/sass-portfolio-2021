# Portfolio Site using SASS

This is just a simple single-page portfolio site that I created to get a better understanding of **SASS**.

A few things to note:

1. I tried to follow the 7-1 architecture pattern but on a much smaller scale using less directories _(since this project is very very small)_.
   - I included the following directories:
     - Abstracts _(utiliy and variable scss files)_
     - Base _(animations, fonts, reset)_
     - Components _(button, card, navbar)_
     - Layouts \_(home)
2. I didn't get a chance to test out _mixins_ so far, but if I continue to expand on this project I will try them out.
3. There is a lot of refactoring I plan to do in the future when I have some additional time.
4. Check out the **Projects** section in my portfolio to see some of my React projects!
